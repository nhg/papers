\begin{letter}{Design That Matters \\
               Cambridge, MA 02139}   
                           
\opening{Dear Sponsor of \#() Externship:}

I was very excited to see the externship ad for Design that Matters. 

I'm a PhD student at CSAIL finishing up my dissertation in sequential decision-making.
I've spent a lot of time working on abstract, theoretical problems, and, it's time to work on a problem that matters to someone. Financial problems represent that application domain.

My background involves considerable Java hacking. The entire system for my PhD, over 35,000 lines of code, was written in Java. So, I have extensive design and testing experience in large software systems.
And also education, specifically math and science. 6.01, for which I learned Python, I am teaching ... so design issues are always at the forefront.
My quantitative background ...

I am also originally from Uruguay. My parents came to the United States as students when I was a young child, and a recurring theme in my life has been how to give back from all I've gained at MIT.  This imbalance can't persist. 

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
