Machine-learning consultant seeking contract work

I received my PhD in machine learning/sequential decision-making at the end of 2007, and since then, have been working on developing trading indicators with a financial research group and, more recently, teaching at the university level. My background includes work in robotic path-planning/navigation, reinforcement learning, clustering, classification, and time-series analysis.  
I've learned my passion lies in applying machine learning techniques to concrete problems, and I am looking to take my strong quantitative background to new domain areas. I'm particularly interested in modeling/optimization problems in the area of energy efficiency and distribution (e.g., "smart grid" technologies), but I am also seeking experience in internet search engines, recommender systems, and portfolio risk-minimization, for example.

Below is a summary of my CV. For more details and contact info, please send an email.
